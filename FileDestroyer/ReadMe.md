<h1>FileDestroyer</h1>
Simple scripts to destory files in the same folder directory</br>
The files will be unrecoverable after the process, tested with the software DiskDigger</br>

> Support file type: .jpg .jpeg .png .webp .mp4 .webm .webp .m4v .gif </br>
(You can add more file extension by adding it using notepad or notepad++)</br>

<h1>How to use</h1>

> 1. Place both files in the folder you want to nuke </br>

> 2. Click on bye1.cmd first (this will convert all files to txt, then erase all content inside the files, aka overwrite every bit to 0, and change the file name to numbers) </br>

> 3. Click on bye2.cmd (this will delete all txt files in the current folder) </br>

<h1>Why are there 2 files?</h1>

Because I can't find a way to implement "del" function after the for loop :^(

> **Note**: Deleted files will go to Drive:\$RECYCLE.BIN, with these 2 scripts all files are unrecoverable because of bit overwrite.
